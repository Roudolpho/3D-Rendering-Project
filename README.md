# 3D-Rendering-Project
This is a 3D rendering project I have been developing using JavaScript. 
This program is fun to look at and mess around with but it still has many things to develop such as in game objects, 
the ability to switch rooms, the ability to create ground tiles, and more. 
In order to run the program, the HTML file can simply be dragged into chrome and should be functional their.
